# Data Analysis: Advanced Functional Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project is focused on applying **Functional Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** methods using Python. The analysis methods used in the project aim to deeply understand, clean, and visualize the data.

## About the Project

In this project, various steps of **Functional Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** were applied to a dataset to thoroughly understand its structure, distributions, and relationships. The goal is to improve the quality and meaning of the data to prepare it for the modeling phase.

The EDA process follows these key steps:

- Data loading and initial exploration
- Missing data analysis
- Analysis of categorical and numerical variables' distributions
- Outlier detection
- Correlation and relationship analysis
- Data visualization techniques

## Libraries Used

The following Python libraries are used in this project:

- `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis
- `numpy`: Numerical computations
- `matplotlib`: Data visualization
- `seaborn`: Advanced data visualization

## Dataset

This project uses the titanic dataset.

## Functional EDA Steps

1. **Understanding the Data:**
    - General examination of the data structure and variables.
    - Summary statistics and data type analysis.
2. **Missing Data Analysis:**
    - Identification and visualization of missing values.
    - Handling missing data using appropriate methods.
3. **Categorical and Numerical Variable Analysis:**
    - Frequency tables and distribution visualizations for categorical and numerical variables.
4. **Outlier Detection:**
    - Detection and analysis of outliers.
5. **Correlation and Relationship Analysis:**
    - Examination of relationships between variables and creation of correlation matrices.
6. **Data Visualization:**
    - Visualizing the data with graphs and charts to enhance understanding.
